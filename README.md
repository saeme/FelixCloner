[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)

FelixCloner is a C++ program that simulates multiple "Felix" processes working in parallel to fix broken cells in a shared memory matrix. Inspired by Fix-It Felix from *Wreck-It Ralph*, this project demonstrates the use of shared memory, process synchronization, and modular design in C++.

## Features

- **Shared Memory Matrix**: The matrix is stored in shared memory, allowing multiple Felix processes to access and modify it.
- **Process Synchronization**: A semaphore ensures that only one Felix modifies the matrix at a time.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: The number of Felixes, matrix dimensions, and broken cells can be configured via command-line arguments.
- **Resource Cleanup**: Shared memory and semaphores are cleaned up automatically after execution.
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests using Google Test ensure correctness and reliability.

## Dependencies

To build and run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

1. **C++ Compiler**: A modern C++ compiler that supports C++17 (e.g., GCC or Clang).
2. **CMake**: Version 3.16 or higher.
3. **Google Test**: For running unit tests.
4. **POSIX APIs**: The program uses POSIX shared memory and semaphore APIs (`shm_open`, `sem_open`, etc.).

### Installing Dependencies

#### On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libgtest-dev
```

#### On macOS:
```bash
brew install cmake googletest
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/FelixCloner.git
   cd FelixCloner
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

3. **Run the Program**:
   After building, the executable `felix_cloner` will be created in the `build/` directory. Run it with the following syntax:
   ```bash
   ./felix_cloner <num_felixes> <rows> <cols> <broken_cells>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   ./felix_cloner 5 10 10 20
   ```

4. **Run Tests**:
   To run the unit tests:
   ```bash
   ./tests
   ```
   Or use CMake's test runner:
   ```bash
   ctest
   ```

## Usage

### Command-Line Arguments

The program accepts the following arguments:

| Argument       | Description                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `num_felixes`  | Number of Felix processes to spawn.             |
| `rows`         | Number of rows in the shared memory matrix.     |
| `cols`         | Number of columns in the shared memory matrix.  |
| `broken_cells` | Number of broken cells to initialize in the matrix. |

### Example Output

When running the program:
```bash
./felix_cloner 5 10 10 20
```

You might see output like:
```
Felix 0 fixed cell at (2, 3)
Felix 1 fixed cell at (5, 7)
Felix 0 has nothing to fix and is exiting.
Felix 1 has nothing to fix and is exiting.
All Felixes have finished fixing the matrix.
```

## Testing

The project includes unit tests implemented using Google Test. To run the tests:

1. Build the project as described in the [Setup Instructions](#setup-instructions).
2. Run the `tests` executable:
   ```bash
   ./tests
   ```
   Or use CMake's test runner:
   ```bash
   ctest
   ```

Expected output:
```
